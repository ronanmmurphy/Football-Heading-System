# Football-Heading-System
Detecting the forces involved in the sub-concussive heading of a ball in the game of soccer. This involves implementing real-world detectors on head and ball to measure and feed information back, with Bluetooth, from two ‘Arduino’ microprocessors to an app created using ‘Android Studios’. This app analyses and displays the information and the protocol of the outcome. Over 300 training case headers were recorded and labelled to categories based on their severity. An LSTM time-series Neural Network was created in Python using TensorFlow, which achieved an accuracy of over 70%. This could be improved greatly with more data but time-restrictions prevented this from being possible. The results of new headers are used as test data and return a classification.
